### Course description
The UP 221 course at UCLA introduces mapping and GIS using Python where students work on a group mapping project.

### Project ideas
Specific ideas
+ I'm working on my thesis for my non-MURP degree where I'm trying to figure out the safety concerns of queer transit users in Mexico City. Some crime and travel behavior are available and mapping this data might be helpful for my thesis. 
+ Last year, I took Environmentalisms and I focused on studying a borough in Mexico City. I found that certain areas had higher exposure to pollutants. I wanted to use public health data to figure out exactly what areas are the most affected, but this data is not public. I think creating a map of sources of pollution (highways, highly transited corridors, power/waste plants) that serves as a proxy for figuring out what communities are the most affected by pollution. 
+ Travel behavior data is often presented as a number (i.e.,"2% of the population commutes by bike"). What if we could collect data on how a select group traveled and provide the information as a map? I've done this type of mapping with e-scooter data, but it would be more interesting to visualize how, for example, minimum wage workers travel. Of course, we already know that commutes are typically very long for this group since they can't afford to live near their jobs, but I haven't seen a mapped visualization of this data. 

General ideas
+ Mapping travel behavior 
+ Mapping pollution 

### Course objectives
I come to this class with a basic understanding of coding in python and making maps. In this course, I want to strengthen my skills and build a portfolio.
